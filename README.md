## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the **machine learning calibration work** for the research paper  
**“Performance Evaluation of Low-Cost Sensors Under Different Aerosols.”**

The project focuses on **calibrating low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors** using advanced regression algorithms.  
Low-cost sensors (LCSs) are widely used for air quality monitoring but often suffer from inaccuracies due to temperature, humidity, and aerosol composition.  
By leveraging **machine learning models**, we aim to improve their performance relative to a **high-end reference instrument (GRIMM 11-A)**.

## 🌫️ Research Summary

The study evaluates the performance of low-cost sensors under **four aerosol conditions**:

- Arizona road dust  
- Compressor oil  
- Incense smoke  
- Sodium chloride (NaCl) particles  

Each sensor was exposed to controlled aerosols in an environmental chamber, and their raw outputs were compared to the **GRIMM 11-A reference sensor**.  
Calibration was performed using several algorithms, including both **statistical** and **machine learning-based** approaches.

## ⚙️ Sensors Used

| Category | Model | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Low-cost | Plantower PMSA003 | Optical particle counter (PM1, PM2.5, PM10) |
| Low-cost | Sensirion SPS30 | Laser-based PM sensor with temperature and humidity compensation |
| Reference | GRIMM 11-A | High-accuracy optical particle counter used as the calibration reference |

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**
   - Parallel measurement using Plantower and Sensirion sensors alongside GRIMM 11-A.
   - Experiments conducted under controlled aerosol conditions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning, synchronization, and filtering of time-series data.  
   - Normalization and feature selection for ML models.

3. **Machine Learning Calibration**
   - Algorithms used:
     - Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
     - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
     - XGBoost Regressor
     - Artificial Neural Network (for reference comparison)
     - Linear & Quadratic Regression (baseline)

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Coefficient of Determination (**R²**)  
   - Root Mean Square Error (**RMSE**)  
   - Mean Absolute Error (**MAE**)

## 📊 Key Observations

- **Machine learning models** significantly outperformed linear and quadratic calibration.  
- **Sensirion SPS30** showed the best agreement with GRIMM 11-A, with RMSE values < 7 µg/m³.  
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** achieved the highest R² and lowest RMSE across all aerosol types.  
- The calibration successfully reduced bias and improved overall sensor reliability.
